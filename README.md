## About the Game
Pong Ping is a game developed by Team Wizzard. It follows the general rules of a traditional Ping Pong game—but digital.

## Game Mechanics
* The game involves two players, with each player responsible for controlling their respective paddle. The paddles can be moved using the "W" and "S" keys, as well as the "Up" and "Down" arrows on the keyboard.
* Once the game starts, the ball will get automatically thrown onto the screen.
* The player’s goal is to prevent the opponent from successfully returning the ball after it crosses over to their side of the screen. Each time the opponent fails to make a return, you earn a point.
* The first player to get the 3 points win!
